To include the SPT likelihood in your code:

1) Add the files to the respective subdirectories in your CosmoMC install (ie files in batch3/ go into the batch3 directory).

2) Recompile cosmomc with the new code.

3) Add to your ini file for the chain: 
DEFAULT(batch3/SPT_hiell.ini)

Note: These instructions assume you have the Jul'19 release of cosmomc.

To install
----------

First edit and run make

Then edit setup.py and do
python setup.py install

To test  without installation
python setup.py build_ext --inplace

To use
------
First change you LD_LIBRARY_PATH to include the current location (the location where libegfs.so is installed) then

simple test :

python
import egfs
ego,pv = egfs.testme("data")
rq,drq = ego(pv)


Something more complicated :
import egfs

lmin = 0
lmax=2500

freq = [100,143,217,353,545,857]
norm_freq = 143 #normalize against this freq

# let's vary only the norms fo cib clustering, cib poisson and radio gal
pn = ["norm_dg_cl","norm_dg_po","norm_rg"]

# let's include all models and fix them to their default values
defmod = ["cib poisson","cib clustering","radio poisson","tsz","ksz"]

ego,pv = egfs.simple_egfs(lmin,lmax,freq,norm_freq,varpars=pn,defmodels=defmod,datapath="./")
rq,drq = ego(pv)

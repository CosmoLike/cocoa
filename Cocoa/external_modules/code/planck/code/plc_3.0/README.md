Important update May 2021: A bug was reported in the code of the CMB marginalized version of the lensing likelihood. The bug caused a first order correction in the computation of the likelihood to be miscomputed and as a consequence biased cosmological results. The bug was only present in the distributed R3.00 and R3.01 of the likelihood code. It is not present in the other implementation of the likelihood (such as cosmoMC or cobaya version). The bug was not present in the versions of the code used to produce the Legacy lensing paper (Planck-2020-A8[5]) or the released public chains. The issue is corrected with the package R3.10. The correction works with the previously distributed likelihood data files.

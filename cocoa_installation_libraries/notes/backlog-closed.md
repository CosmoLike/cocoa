## FAST-PT two-grid upgrade (2026-09)

- **Two-grid theory block.** The wrapper now computes its FFTLog
  convolutions on a coarse internal grid and upsamples with a cubic
  spline in log k onto the dense output table the likelihood reads
  linearly. `accuracyboost` scales the output table,
  `internal_accuracyboost` the internal grid, and both are rebased so
  1.0 is the converged default; values above 8 are refused with the
  reason. Shipped as PyFAST-PT v1.0; README added in v1.01.
- **Divergence located.** The historical CFASTPT vs FASTPT
  disagreement (up to Δχ² = 21 at LSST-Y1 precision and Δχ² = 87184
  at Roman precision on the shared single 1,100-point grid) lived
  entirely in the density of the interpolated output table and none
  of it in the convolutions.
- **Six projects converged.** The comparison test passes at the
  defaults on lsst_y1, roman_real, desy1xplanck, des_y3, and roman_kl
  (which keeps a density-independent floor ≈ 0.175); roman_fourier
  needs `accuracyboost: 2.0`. Each `tests/README.md` carries the
  contract, the measurement table, and the corner plot; the example
  yamls carry the rebased defaults.

## Shared test harness (2026-09)

- **cocoa_testing.py.** About ten thousand duplicated lines of unit
  test python across five projects consolidated into
  `external_modules/code/cosmolike_core/cocoa_testing.py`
  (`CocoaTestHarness`: frozen-state integrity, chi2 pipeline, baryon
  checks, worker isolation, race checks, CFASTPT vs FASTPT
  comparison). The projects became data-only shims binding one
  harness instance; the full suites reproduced their digits exactly
  before and after. Shipped in cosmolike_core v4.11.6.

## Installation scripts (2026-09)

- **SWITCH_TO_DEV_MODE for setup_pyfastpt.sh.** The wrapper clone now
  routes through the per-script `devurl()` helper like every other
  CosmoLike-org repository; `set_installation_options.sh` keeps the
  https address.
- **Tag checkout refname fix.** The wrapper's tag checkout uses the
  `-b "${TAG}TMP"` form the other setup scripts use, removing the
  ambiguous-refname failure when a branch and a tag share a name.

## Release train (2026-09-23)

- **Nine repositories released** and pinned in
  `set_installation_options.sh`: cocoa v4.11.7, cosmolike_core
  v4.11.6, lsst_y1 v4.11.2, roman_real v4.11.2, desy1xplanck v4.11.1,
  des_y3 v4.11.1, roman_fourier v4.11.1, roman_kl v4.11.4, PyFAST-PT
  v1.01, BFMT v1.01. Every pin verified against an existing remote
  tag; every repository cycled onto a fresh `bugfix` from its updated
  `main`.

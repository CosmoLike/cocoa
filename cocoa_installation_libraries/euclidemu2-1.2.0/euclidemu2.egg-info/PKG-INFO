Description: # EuclidEmulator2 (version 1.0.1)
        This package includes a python wrapper of EuclidEmulator2, a fast and accurate tool to estimate the non-linear correction to the matter power spectrum developed by M. Knabenhans.
        EuclidEmulator2 allows for 8-parameter cosmological models including massive neutrinos (assuming a degenerate hierarchy) and dynamical dark energy. The source for EuclidEmulator2 is written in C++, with most main functions accessed through the python wrapper.

        ## Currently implemented features in this python wrapper:
        * emulation of the non-linear correction factor <i>B(k,z)</i>
        * large allowed redshift interval: <i>z</i> in the interval [0.0,10.0]
        * spatial scales spanning more than three orders of magnitude: 8.73 x 10<sup>-3</sup> <i>h</i> / Mpc ≤ <i>k</i> ≤ 9.41 <i>h</i> / Mpc.
        
        * Cosmology defined via parameter dictionary
        * Outputs numpy arrays
        * Can output in custom k-range with extrapolation outside default range
        
        See below for a tutorial on usage explaining these functionalities
        
        ## Quick start
        ### Prerequisites
        In any case you need:
         * C++11 or later
         * GNU Scientific Library version 2.5 or higher (GSL; see https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/)
         * g++ version 4.9.1 or higher
        
        #### GSL install
        On most machines, building GSL is relatively simple. To install it locally, e.g. in `~/local/gsl`, use
        ```
        mkdir -p $HOME/local/gsl && cd $HOME/local
        wget -c ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gsl/gsl-latest.tar.gz -O - | tar zxv
        ```
        The install procedure follows standard steps, but each one might take several minutes. Execute each command separately and only continue if there are no errors.
        ```
        ./configure --prefix=$HOME/local/gsl
        make
        make check
        make install
        ```
         Once done, make sure to add the GSL library to your library path with
         ```
         export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/local/gsl/lib${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH}
         ```
        
        ### Usage
        
        To load the package in python use
        
        ```
        import euclidemu2
        ```
        
        The main function is `get_boost(cosmo_par, redshifts, k_custom=None)` that takes a dictionary of cosmological parameters, an array with the requested redshifts and an optional array with a custom range of wave numbers. It outputs an array with the k values used and a dictionary with the boosts, indexed in the same order as the chosen redshifts. An example run looks like
        
        ```
        import euclidemu2
        import numpy as np
        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        
        ee2=euclidemu2.PyEuclidEmulator()
        
        cosmo_par={'As':2.1e-09, 'ns':0.966, 'Omb':0.04,'Omm':0.3,'h':0.68,'mnu':0.15,'w':-1.0,'wa':0.0}
        redshifts=[0,2,4,6,8,10]
        k, b = ee2.get_boost(cosmo_par,redshifts)
        
        for i in range(len(redshifts)):
            plt.loglog(k,b[i],label="z="+str(redshifts[i]))
        
        plt.legend()
        plt.show()
        ```
        
        If everything is correctly installed, this should produce a plot of the boosts for the chosen redshifts.
        
        Should the user have installed `classy`, it is also possible to compute the full non-linear power spectrum via
        ```
        k, pnl, plin, b = ee2.get_pnonlin(cosmo_par, redshifts, k_custom)
        ```
        which will now output `pnl` in addition to the linear power spectrum `plin` and the boost `b`, which are all indexed in the same way as the boost from `get_boost`.
        
        If `classy` is not installed, a warning will appear when loading `euclidemu2` and the `get_pnonlin` function will not work. The `get_boost` function will always work.
        
        <b>Warning:</b> In the most recent versions of Python (e.g. 3.8) `classy` may not work unless it is the first package to be imported. This is taken into account when calling `euclidemu2`, but implies that `euclidemu2` must be the first package to be imported. This has been verified not to be a problem for older versions of python (e.g. 3.6).
